# Summary

<!-- 
This should include a short description of which models you have tried and conclusions from comparing these models. This should be no longer than an abstract. This section can also include questions regarding the assignment.
-->

# Performance
<!-- 
This should include a table of performance metrics of different models. The performance metrics should at least include accuracy and F1-score.

## Running the code
You can run the reproduce all the experiments by cloning the GitHub repository and running the following:

<!-- 
Update the code below such that it runs all the experiments in the performance section and print the performances. It might be preferable to set a seed to ensure reproducibility.
-->
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ner/main.py --epochs 10 --gensim_embedding glove-wiki-gigaword-50
```
